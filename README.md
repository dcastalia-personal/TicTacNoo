Tic Tac Noo is a cheeky anti-match-three puzzle game with 25 brain-teasing levels built strictly using Unity's data-oriented technology stack (DOTS) â€“ no MonoBehaviour logic.  All code and assets, except for the audio, were created for the Turbo Makes Games DOTS Jam 1, where this project won the 3rd place prize, and may be used by others without restriction.  The licensed audio is excluded.

Open the project in Unity 6000.0 for best compatibility.
