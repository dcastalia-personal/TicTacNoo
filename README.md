Tic Tac Noo is a cheeky anti-match-three puzzle game with 11 brain-teasing levels built strictly using Unity's data-oriented technology stack (DOTS) â€“ no MonoBehaviour logic.  All code and assets were created for the Turbo Makes Games DOTS Jam 1 and may be used by others without restriction.

Commits created during the game jam were made in PlasticSCM (and therefore private), so the history is missing here.  Open the project in Unity 6000.0 for best compatibility.
